# Personal dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I manage them with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Usage

Checkout this repository to an appropriate location (for example, `~/.dotfiles`),
then run `cd ~/.dotfiles` and `stow <directory>` where `<directory>` is one of the
directories in this repository, for example `nvim`.
